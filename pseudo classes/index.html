        Pseudo-classes are a way to select HTML elements based on their state as opposed to their HTML
        structure. You can read more about pseudo-classes here.

        Pseudo-classes must always be applied to an existing selector. Their "flag character" is
        the colon (":"), as you can see used in the below examples. Here are some of the most
        popular pseudo-classes.
