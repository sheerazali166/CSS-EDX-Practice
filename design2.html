        <p>This property sets the foreground color of an element's text content. By default, all text content will be set to black. If you set the color on one HTML element it will be inherited by all HTML elements within that. For example, if you set the color property on the body tag to blue, all text on your web page will be changed to blue, unless that text has a more specific color property that will override it.</p>
