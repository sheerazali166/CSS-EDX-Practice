        Pseudo-classes are a way to select HIML elements based on their state as opposed to their
        HTML structure. You can read more about pseudo-classes here. Pseudo-classes must always be
        applied to an existing selector. Their "flag character" is the colon ("-"), as you can see
        used in the below examples. Here are some of the most popular pseudo-classes.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    your name: <input type="text">
    <!-- <input type="submit" value="submit"> -->
    <button>Submit</button>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        These pseudo classes are the ones you are probably most familiar with. Even on this page
        you've probably noticed that links have different style than paragraph text. The tag by
        default sets the text color to blue with an underline, but have you ever seen a purple
        link? This is the "visited" pseudo-class that applies a different style to links that the
        user has already clicked. The opposite of visited is "link" which is a link a user has not
        yet clicked. These two states are mutually exclusive, meaning a link cannot be both at the
        same time.

    <ol>
        <li>
            The hover pseudo-class is applied when the user points at an object but doesn't activate it
        </li>
        <li>
            most commonly when they let their mouse cursor lay on top of an element without clicking
        </li>
        <li>
            Some form factors don't support this, such as touch devices or pen surfaces
        </li>
    </ol>
