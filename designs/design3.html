        <p>This property sets the background color of an element.
            This color then represents the exact space the element takes up,
            which is always a rectangular area. The default value is 'transparent'
            which means whatever is behind the element will shine through.
            Note that background-color is one example of a property that is not
            inherited, so you will have to directly set the background-color
            on each element. To set the overall color of your page apply a background
            color to the body tag, and since all other element's background colors
            will be transparent by default it will appear as if everything has that
            same background color.</p>
